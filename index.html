      <h1>Context</h1>

      <p>
        The goal of this assignment is to practice the workflow of redesigning a
        simple website: to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface,
        create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen
        sizes, and build a responsive website based on those prototypes.
      </p>

      <h3>Old Website</h3>

      /></a>

      <h2>Why I chose this website</h2>

      <p>
        I chose this website because it looks really outdated and although it is
        usable, in terms of design choices and accessibility, I would change
        many things including making better use of the white space, font size
        and color, and generally updating the website and visual flow to make it
        more intuitive for various screen sizes.
      </p>

      <h2>Usability Problems</h2>

      <h4>Learnability</h4>
      <p>
        The learnability is mediocre as if a new user were to book a
        performance, one would have to click on the contact information page and
        then use the contact information provided on that page. It may not be
        intuitive since one would expect it on the home page screen where it is
        more easily accessible.
      </p>

      <h4>Memorability</h4>
      <p>
        It would not be memorable for the casual user since on certain pages,
        the headings are not clear and sometimes non-existent. It would be
        difficult to remember where the essential information lies on each page.
        Again, there is nothing prompting the user to book a performance.
      </p>

      <h4>Efficiency</h4>
      <p>
        It has poor efficiency due to each page being super short with
        information and mostly cluttered with images. Users will have to
        frequently make use of the side navigation bar. Furthermore the side
        navigation bar is not fixed during scrolling so users will have to
        scroll all the way back up to navigate to other pages.
      </p>

      <h4>Accessibility</h4>
      <p>
        Using the WebAIM WAVE, I found that there were 2 contrast errors, 11
        alerts, 8 features, and 2 structural elements. I agree with the contrast
        error as it has to do with a banner blending into the background, alerts
        and features dealing with alternative text as the alternative text for
        the images are all unhelpful and listed as “picture”, and lastly I agree
        with the structural errors that involve missing a hierarchy of headings.
      </p>

      <h3>Low-Fidelity PC View</h3>

      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap">
        <img src="pc-1.jpg" height="300" />

        <img src="pc-3.jpg" height="300" />
        <img src="pc-4.jpg" height="300" />
      </div>

      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap">
        <img src="tablet-1.jpg" height="300" />
        <img src="tablet-2.jpg" height="300" />
        <img src="tablet-3.jpg" height="300" />
        <img src="tablet-4.jpg" height="300" />

      </div>

      <h3>High-Fidelity PC View</h3>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap">
        <img src="pc-hi.jpg" height="1000" />
      </div>

      <h3>High-Fidelity Tablet View</h3>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap">
        <img src="tablet-hi.jpg" height="1000" />
      </div>

      <h3>High-Fidelity Phone View</h3>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap">
        <img src="phone-hi.jpeg" height="1000" />
      </div>

      <h4>Annotation</h4>
      <p>
        Using Bootstrap, I was able to create a navbar, text, button and other
        elements to be responsive. I used flex column, justify-content-center,
        and align-items-center to center things. I used containers for the text
        and lastly used bootstrap row and col for resizing the container for
        kung fu and lion dance. I played around with different margins and
        paddings. For hover states, I changed their brightness for when the btn
        is being hovered.
